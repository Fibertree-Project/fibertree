class Fiber:
    """A base class for representing a tensor as a tree of fibers

    The Fiber class implements the concept of a fiber of a tensor.  A
    Fiber is comprised of a list of **coordinates** and associated
    **payloads**.

    Fiber coordinates are unique tags for each element of the Fiber,
    they are often integers in the open range [0 to **shape**), where
    **shape** is an attribute of the Fiber.  However, coordinates may
    be other types, such as `tuples`. For example, `tuple` coordinates
    can be generated by `Fiber.flattenRanks()`.

    Fiber payloads are a value associated with each
    coordinate. Payloads may themselves be Fibers, which permits the
    creation of **fibertrees**. The payloads of the leaf level of the
    fibertree will be terminal values. Since we want to enable code to
    hold and update a payload (outside the context of the Fiber) we
    usually **box** the leaf level payloads using the `Payload` class
    (see `fibertree.core.payload`).

    A Fiber may have not have values for every possible coordinate
    (i.e., the coordinate list may have gaps). Such missing
    coordinates are referred to as being **empty**.

    Fibers can be iterated and return a series of `CoordPayload`
    elements (see `fibertree.core.coord_payload`).

    Attributes
    ----------

    Fibers have a set of attributes that can be set and
    accessed. These include:

    - A **default** value, which is the value associated with an
      **empty** coordinate and is accessed with `Fiber.getDefault()`
      and may be returned by methods that access a point in the Fiber
      such as `Fiber.getPayload()` and `Fiber.getPayloadRef()`.

    - A **shape**, which specifies the **size** of the fiber and
      controls the range of legal (integer) coordinates. The shape of
      an individual fiber is an integer, while the shape of a
      fibertree will be a list of integers corresponding to the
      shapes of the fibers at each level of the tree. A fiber's (or
      fibertree's) shape can be accessed with `Fiber.getShape()`

    - An **ordered** attribute which indicates and maintains the
      invariant that the coordinates of the fiber are monitonically
      increasing.

    - A **unique** attribute which indicates and maintains the
      invariant that the coordinates of the fiber are unique.

    - An **owner** rank. Since fibers are often part of a `Tensor`,
      the fiber may have an owning rank (see `Fiber.setOwner()`). When
      owned by a rank, some fiber atributes are actually obtained from
      that rank rather than being stored locally.

    - A **savedPos**, which is a value stored by certain methods that
      records a postion in a fiber that can be used in the future as a
      **shortcut** to accelerate a search in the fiber by another
      method. See `Fiber.iterShape()` for an example of a method that
      both saves and can use these **shortcuts**.

    Constructor
    -----------

    The `Fiber` constructor creates an fiber with a given set of
    coordinates and payloads (in struct of lists form).

    Parameters
    ----------

    coords: list, default=[]
        List of coordinate values

    payloads: list, default=[]
        List of corresponding payloads for the coordinates

    default: value, default=0
        Default value of a payload in this fiber

    shape: integer, default=None
        Declared shape for the fiber

    initial: value, default=None
        A value to initialize all payloads.

    max_coord: value, default=no maximum coordinate
            The maximum legal coordinate value (this is really "shape-1")

    ordered: Boolean, default=True
        Attribute specifing that the coordinates are monotonically increasing

    unique: Boolean, default=True
        Attribute specifing that the coordinates are unique


    Notes
    -----

    Elements of the fiber have a `position` that can be used to
    reference the element. Generally one can think of the `position` as
    the relative address of the element in the concrete represention of
    the fiber. A variety of methods use a `postion` to reference an
    element, such as `Fiber.__getitem__()` and `Fiber.__setitem__()`

    Currently, the internal implementation of a Fiber is to hold a list
    of coordinates and a list of payloads (struct of lists) and the
    instance variables holding those lists (coords and payloads) are
    currently left public...

        a value otherwise it will return a fiber. [Non-mutating]

        This method operates in two modes: allocate=True and False.

        For "allocate=True" mode, if any coordinate refers to a
        non-existent element, a payload is created (a fiber for at a
        non-leaf level or a zero at the leaf) recursively, but not
        inserted into the fiber tree. The final such payload is
        returned to the caller.

        For "allocate=False" mode, if any coordinate refers to a
        non-existent element, nothing is created and the `default`
        value is returned.

        If `start_pos` is specified it is used as a shortcut to start the
        search for the coordinate. And a new position is saved for use in
        a later search. Only works for a one-deep search.
