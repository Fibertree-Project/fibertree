    "## Naming conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "To make reading fiber tree-based code a bit easier, we try to use a consistent variable naming convention in this and other notebooks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rank shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "The **shape** of a rank (and all the fibers in a rank) is the maximum number of coordinates in each fiber. Variables holding the **shape** of all the fibers in a rank is usually a single uppercase character corresponding to the the name of the rank. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Fibers in ranks \"M\" and \"K\" have shapes 4 and 6, respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "M = 4\n",
    "K = 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tensors** are either identified by a single lowercase letter or a single lowercase letter, an underscore (\\_), and the names of the ranks in the tensor. The rank names are listed in order from top to bottom of the fiber tree. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Two tensors with ranks named \"M\" and \"K\"\n",
    "\n",
    "a = Tensor(rank_ids=[\"M\", \"K\"])\n",
    "a_MK = Tensor(rank_ids=[\"M\", \"K\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fibers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fibers** that are extracted from the ranks of a tensor are named with the lowercase name of the tensor, an underscore (\\_), and a lowercase letter matching the name of the fiber's rank. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get the root fiber from a tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "a_m = a_MK.getRoot()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the naming of the variable holding the root fiber of a tensor follows from the name of the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "When accessing elements of a fiber one can use the **Fiber.getPayload()** to access the payload by **coordinate**. Coordinates are named with a lowercase letter corronding the the name of the fiber's rank. An example assuming the coordianates in a fiber are in the open range from 0 to \"rank shape\" and using **Fiber.getPayload()** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the payloads (which happen to be fibers) at each coordinate in the a_m fiber\n",
    "\n",
    "for m in range(M):\n",
    "    a_k = a_m.getPayload(m)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the name of the coordinate follows from the name of the fiber.\n",
    "\n",
    "This convention for coordinate and payload fiber names will also be used when iterating through a fiber in the cells below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensor values\n",
    "\n",
    "The values as the the bottom of a tensor's fiber tree, i.e., leaf values, will be a terminal value. For Python programming language reasons, we need to distinguish between such values that are just going to be used computaionally as a input (right-hand side of an assignment) and an output (left-hand side of an assigment or update). So we use a lowercase letter corresponding to the name of the tensor followed by either \\_val or \\_ref to indicate those two cases. Such values are generated by the **Fiber.getPayload{,Ref}()** and also the fiber mutation/insertion operator (<<). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the value and a reference to a fiber element's payload at the lowest rank of a tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "k = 0 \n",
    "\n",
    "a_val = a_k.getPayload(k)\n",
    "a_ref = a_k.getPayloadRef(k)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This distinction tends to only needed at the leaf payloads of a fiber tree, since variables holding a fiber tend to behave properly as either a value or a reference.\n"
