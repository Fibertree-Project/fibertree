    "## Introduction\n",

    "The **fibertree** abstraction is a representation-agnostic way of thinking about sparse and dense tensors and the operators that manipulate those tensors. By **representation agnostic** we mean a generic representation of a tensor that is independent of the specifics of a particular in-memory format, such as CSR or CSF. Thus although the costs of operations will be a function of the specific representation, one can think of the operations on them generically. Thus, using this representation one can explore the algorithmic processing and operations uses by various accelerator architectures. More background on this abstraction for representing tensors can be found sections 8.2 and 8.3 of the book [Efficient Processing of Deep Neural Networks](https://tinyurl.com/EfficientDNNBook).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks in these directories provide an introduction and examples of use of Python implementation of operators and algorithms on tensors (and other objects) in the fibertree abstraction. A good starting point that includes an introduction to the basic operators and graphical representations of tensors and sequences of operations can be found in [fibertree basics](./basic/fibertree.ipynb)\n",
